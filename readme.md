# Understanding the app we will be building
For our project, I will be building a movie reviews app that will allow users to view and
search for movies

Users will also be able to log in and post reviews of any movies they may have watched, They will be able to type in and add their review, Users can see the list of reviews on a movie's page and post, edit, or delete their own
review if they are logged in. They will not be able to edit or delete other users' reviews
though. Through building this app,  will learn a lot of concepts, such as forms, user
authorization, permissions, foreign keys, and more.
